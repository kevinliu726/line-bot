Characteristic & Personality:
I would describe myself with the following words:
Lion-hearted: I am taking every single opportunity without regrets. Learning, developing, and seeing beauty in all kinds of moments in life, no matter how big/small they may be. I fight for what I stand for and never give up on my dream.
Independent: Others do not easily influence me; I do my homework, double-check everything I heard, and take a firm stand on what I think is right. Yet, I'm not stubborn, listening and communicating is both my strength. I am not afraid of making mistakes and shouldering the blame.
Novelty seeking: I'm audacious to explore the unknown and willing to face great challenges. I liked to challenge myself to step outside my comfort zone and embrace the uncertainty.
Empathetic: I'm able to put myself in someone else's shoes. I can quickly build relationships and connections with strangers. Most importantly, I really cared about the people I've encountered.
