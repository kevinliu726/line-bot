Experience:
Under the supervision of Prof. Chung-Wei Lin at NTU and Prof. Aviral Shrivastava at Arizona State University (ASU), I am interested in and adept at studying embedded systems, particularly cyber-physical systems. The co-authored research paper "Cooperative Driving of Connected Autonomous Vehicles Using Responsibility-Sensitive Safety Rules" is accepted and will be present in ACM/IEEE International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems (ICCPS), Virtual (Nashville, TN), May. 2021. This research and collaboration experience equipped me with critical thinking and oral presentation.
Besides the personal academic experience, I have had the opportunity to gain hands-on experience dealing with real-life problems as a software engineer intern at Grindr, the most prominent gay chat app. During the internship, cross-department cooperation and high-pressured timelines were the daily routines; I even coordinated one of our app's main features, which prompted a 10% registration rate.
